This works links to the relevance of \cite{Yang2016} suggesting the use of symmetric-$\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) distribution which better accounts for the impulsive noise. This technique has been used before ##references##. The use of this alternative model has to be accounted for using a variation of the maximum likelihood algorithm due to the typically non closed nature of S$\alpha$S. This highlights the use of the cauchy distribution which is a special closed form of S$\alpha$S. However typically cauchy detectors are very complex and very expensive, however there are various sub-optimal solutions that work as well, the myriad detector is an improved cauchy detector. Proposing the equal the performance of the maximum likelihood techniques that work on the basis of a more uniform closed distribution of background noise. \cite{Yue2016} also considers the affects of the impulsive noise, but using differential demodulation ML algorithms as an impact of mitigating the effect of the impulse interference.
