Here, we make use of ∼4 Hz-66 MHz radio waves emitted by two consecutive intense positive lightning discharges to investigate their impact on the atmosphere above a thundercloud. It is found that the first positive lightning discharge initiates a sprite where electrons are accelerated during the exponential growth and branching of the sprite streamers. This preconditioned plasma above the thundercloud is subsequently exposed to a second positive lightning discharge associated with a bouncing-wave discharge. This discharge process causes a re-brightening of the existing sprite streamers above the thundercloud and initiates a subsequent relativistic electron beam. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The high time resolution enables a novel comparison of the measurements with a detailed simulation of the transmitted signal. It is found that the wave propagation frequency response exhibits nonlinear amplitude and phase changes with frequency over the narrow transmission bandwidth during the time of the measurements (13 May 2011 15:00:03–15:00:09 UTC). The high time resolution also enables measurements of fast variabilities in the wave propagation <5 ms. The fast propagation variabilities are likely to originate from integrated ionospheric variability over the propagation path or fast ionospheric processes. The wave propagation frequency response measurement has potential benefits in the study of the lower ionosphere, in particular during highly variable perturbations such as those caused by lightning.},

   abstract = {Analysis of very low frequency lightning waveforms, or radio sferics, can contribute to research into lower ionosphere perturbations and the corresponding atmospheric chemistry. Lightning waveforms can also be characterized on the basis of their propagation distance from receivers in order to study radio wave propagation. A bank of average waveforms, that is, the waveform bank, <1,000 km with a spatial resolution of 10 km has been produced, based on the lightning waveforms recorded in Europe on 8 August 2014. These average lightning waveforms at different distances exhibit a sequence of consecutive maxima resulting from ionospheric reflections, named sky waves. The spectral waveform bank shows a sequence of consecutive modal maxima at different frequencies depending on distance. The Hilbert transform is applied to produce complex lightning waveforms, which provide additional information to the original real waveforms alone, that is, the instantaneous phase and frequency. The time differences calculated from the instantaneous phases of complex lightning waveforms give the minimum arrival time difference error when compared to other analyzed signal processing methods. The derivative of the instantaneous phase, that is, the instantaneous frequency, represents the amplitude-weighted average of frequency components at maximum amplitude according to theory and numerical simulation. In real experiments, the instantaneous frequency can be understood as the median value of the real frequency distribution calculated at maximum amplitude. It is found that the instantaneous frequencies at maximum amplitudes are distance dependent. This finding might enable the development of a novel method to determine lightning distances in the future.},

The propagation attenuation of sea water is first modeled. By considering the impact of suppressing impulsive noise, the multiple-symbols differential demodulation of the underwater VLF MSK signal is then derived based on the principle of maximum likelihood (ML) detection. Extensive simulation results show that the performance of the ML multiple-symbols differential demodulation algorithm can closely approach that of the coherent demodulation algorithm if the carrier phase is recovered and a relative large amount of symbols are utilized. On the other hand, the differential demodulation algorithm is superior to the coherent demodulation algorithm if the carrier phase is not recovered.},

   abstract = {One of the most commonly modeled statistics in atmospheric radio noise studies is the noise envelope voltage amplitude probability distribution (APD). Although a number of models have been introduced to characterize atmospheric noise envelope APDs, the quantity of real data that exist to verify their accuracy is somewhat limited, especially in the ELF and VLF bands. This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis in which thousands of hours of ELF/VLF noise are processed to derive APDs, which are then compared with various APD models to determine which of the models is most accurate. The error criterion used to find the optimal parameters of each APD model, as well as to compare the models against each other, is the expected value of the log error squared (where the log error is the difference in decibels between the data histogram and the model histogram). This criterion provides a means by which the models may be evaluated and compared numerically. The most accurate model is found to depend on geographic location, time of year and day, bandwidth, and center frequency, but two of the simplest models (i.e., each with only two parameters) are found to give extremely good performance in general. These are the Hall and alpha-stable (or α-stable) models, both of which approximate the Rayleigh distribution for low-amplitude values but decay with an inverse power law for high-amplitude values. This paper concludes that the Hall model is the optimal choice in terms of accuracy and simplicity for locations exposed to heavy sferic activity (e.g., lower latitudes) and the α-stable model is best for locations relatively distant from heavy sferic activity (e.g., the polar regions).},

   abstract = {In VLF/LF communication systems, atmospheric noise is the dominant interference, which is usually highly impulsive and can be effectively modeled as symmetric α-stable (SαS) distribution. It has been known that communication techniques designed under Gaussian noise assumption always have poor performance under impulsive noise. In this work, we focus on the detection problem of minimum shift keying (MSK) signals under SαS noise, because this modulation is widely used in VLF/LF communication systems. As SαS distribution usually has no closed form probability density function (PDF), the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) based detection of MSK signals is hard to implement. To address this problem, we proposed a closed form approximation of the branch metric used in the Viterbi algorithm (VA) for MSK coherent detection, and provided a closed form approximation of the local optimal MSK non-coherent detection. Compared with ML based algorithms, the proposed algorithms have closed form and are simple to implement. Simulation results show that the bit error ratio (BER) performance of the proposed MSK coherent detector can closely approach that of the ML based coherent detector. Meanwhile, the proposed MSK non-coherent detector can attain the similar BER performance as that of the ML based non-coherent detector in low signal-to-noise ratio region.},

A range of realistic scenarios based on a high powered GMSK interferer (10 to 30 dB greater than the signal of interest (SOI)) in an adjacent channel are described. It is known that in the presence of interference and Gaussian noise a simple FRESH filter, which exploits the cyclostationarity of the interferer, is highly effective at removing the interference. We show that when non-Gaussian impulsive noise is present, the FRESH filter is still effective against interference, even when the two signals have cyclic frequencies in common. However if hole-punching is used to remove the larger impulses of the noise, this adversely affects the performance of the FRESH filter.},

This atmospheric "noise," originating essentially from lightning discharges, is the main source of interference for VLF/LF telecommunications. One of the statistical measures that is used to define the properties of low-frequency radio noise is the voltage deviation Vd, which is a measure of the impulsiveness of the noise that is widely used to characterize radio noise, particularly in the International Radio Consultative Committee reports. In this paper we present atmospheric noise statistics based on VLF measurements at different temporal resolution (from minutes to seasonal variations). For the first time we present analysis of the statistical parameters of Vd from continuous broadband VLF measurements for a period extending more than 1 year. Our analysis shows that the long-term observed Vd characteristics can be reasonably estimated as the sum of two Gaussians distribution functions, while the hourly and seasonal distributions of Vd values can be fitted using a single Gaussian distribution with different mean and variance values.

It shows how the minimizer can be obtained by a range of computational solver algorithms. In this second paper (part II), using this understanding developed in part I, we introduce several novel PWC denoising methods, which, for example, combine the global behaviour of mean shift clustering with the local smoothing of total variation diffusion, and show example solver algorithms for these new methods. Comparisons between these methods are performed on synthetic and real signals, revealing that our new methods have a useful role to play.

It is shown that the proposed interference-adapted LLR improves the performance substantially in atmospheric noise compared to when the LLR is designed for AWGN. The performance is also compared to a solution, where the soft output from the demodulator is simplified to a limiter, and to a solution when a larger system bandwidth is used in combination with a limiter. It is concluded that the proposed interference-adapted LLR achieves the best performance in the comparison, although the performance could probably be further improved, when compared to the obtained Shannon capacity of this particular interference.},

   abstract = {A new class of differential detection techniques for standardized Feher patented quadrature phase-shift keying (FQPSK) systems is proposed and studied by computer aided design/simulations. It is shown that significant BER performance improvements can be obtained by increasing the received signal's observation time over multi-symbol as well as by adopting trellis-demodulation. While the FQPSK transmitted signal is not trellis coded, its trellis coded interpretation leads to trellis demodulation. For example, our simulation results show that a BER=10-4 can be obtained for an Eb/N0=14.1 dB.},
